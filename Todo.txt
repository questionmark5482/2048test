	I guess the core logic is finished. Next step is to send out signals
	about how the number should move.

	I guess the function slide_left and spawn_number should send out signal.
	
	each block should have method move_to(ii, jj)

	Old problems to be solved:
		the losing condition is wrong.
		Input separate? Signal?
	
	To do designs:
		Now we want to have a separate system for visulization.
		The board logic, and code need to be reorganized.
		The communication between core logic and visulization need to happen. 
		Namely, the core should send formatted signals out.  
		
		Order:
			1. reorganizate code
			2. define signal
			3. visualize

	Input -> 4 commands as output (dir)
	try_slide(dir) -> rotate + slide_left + rotate_back + send_vis_signal

	Try finish a simplest game first. I pick 2048, one of my favourite in high school.
	
	Components:
		Let's say we ignore the animation. Then the board just renew itself when key signal is triggered.
