	Finishing: Color, Font, Menu, and Sound.
	It's easy to fix color and font size. Just make a separate sprite for each number value.

	Last weekend implement the moving feature, spent quite some hours. Yesterday I rearrange the code in GameManager and Board.
	The code in block still requires fixing. Especially, the function move and handle_move maybe should be merged together. And we need a separate function for merge.
	
	Next thing to do is the different appearance of block with its different value. The size change of the lable for large number. The menu and artwork. 

	If the above work can be finished in several days, I can put it on itch.io and my resume, which may greatly increase the chance of finding software developing job!

	The refreshing function of block should not appear in board?
	We can let refresh happen every time the block is moved. 
	
	
	Finished the stressing when two blocks merge.

	I guess the core logic is finished. Next step is to send out signals
	about how the number should move.

	I guess the function slide_left and spawn_number should send out signal.
	
	each block should have method move_to(ii, jj)

	Old problems to be solved:
		the losing condition is wrong.
		Input separate? Signal?
	
	To do designs:
		Now we want to have a separate system for visulization.
		The board logic, and code need to be reorganized.
		The communication between core logic and visulization need to happen. 
		Namely, the core should send formatted signals out.  
		
		Order:
			1. reorganizate code
			2. define signal
			3. visualize

	Input -> 4 commands as output (dir)
	try_slide(dir) -> rotate + slide_left + rotate_back + send_vis_signal

	Try finish a simplest game first. I pick 2048, one of my favourite in high school.
	
	Components:
		Let's say we ignore the animation. Then the board just renew itself when key signal is triggered.
