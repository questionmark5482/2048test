# 2048test
 
This is a test project for me. It took me much time to realize that starting from a SMALL project is actually better.
The goal is to finish this game and polish it, so that I can get familiarized to aspects of Godot, how to organize code, and the overall work stream in developing game. Maybe a few more software as well.
I also expect that more such small project can eventually help the development of my own game ideas, and also maybe land me a job.
Good Luck!
